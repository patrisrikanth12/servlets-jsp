### Servlet 
A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.

### JSP 
A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags. The JSP pages are easier to maintain than Servlet because we can separate designing and development.
